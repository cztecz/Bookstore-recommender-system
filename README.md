# Bookstore-recommender-system
A recommender system trained on two bookstore datsets: BX-Books, BX-Ratings

The following Jupyter Notebook code contains all the necessary processes for our model to
work. It first completes data preprocessing and the training file, then runs some statistics of
the raw data. The model is then computed, and the model is run for the last testing set we
used (the first testing set code was included under ‘NEWBOOK TESTING’ written in
comments). To produce results, click ‘run all cells’ from the navigation bar. It might take a
while to run since the dataset is large, but it should produce all the results and visualisations
once the code is finished. The correct output csv file is the one called ‘Sorted_Books.csv’, it
contains the predicted ratings at the very right column.
